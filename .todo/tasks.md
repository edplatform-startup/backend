# Task Plan

- [x] Update `src/services/grokClient.js` to implement reliability improvements (call limits, retries, caching, prompt updates, validation tweaks).
- [x] Update `src/routes/courses.js` POST handler for timeout guard and fallback behavior.
- [x] Run relevant tests or lint (if feasible) to ensure stability.
